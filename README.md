# Calces-Bibliotheca

Calces-Bibliotheca (Latin for cog-library) is a lightweight Rust crate that provides a simple and ergonomic wrapper around the Stoat API. It abstracts common request handling, authentication, and data structures, allowing developers to interact with Stoat services more easily and with less boilerplate. The goal of Calces-Bibliotheca is to offer a clean, minimal foundation for building bots and integrations on top of Stoat.
